title: Unix for Bioinformatics
---

Paragraph(s) of introductory material.
`Unix` is much more than an environment in which you can execute big programmes like `bwa` or `samtools`. 
Rather, with itâ€™s suite of text searching, extraction and manipulation programmes, 
it is itself a powerful tool for the many small bioinformatic tasks that you will encounter during everyday work.

> What learners need to know before tackling this lesson.
> 
> This tutorial was first given at a next generation sequencing data analysis workshop in March 2013 at Sheffeld University. 
> This tutorial expects you to do all the steps exactly as written from top to bottom. So refrain from experimenting during the first run through it.  
> Your command line prompt will end with a $ sign. So a $ sign in this tutorial tells you to type the stuff that comes '''after''' the $ sign into your command line. 
> The words "folder" and "directory" mean the same thing. So I use them interchangeably.
